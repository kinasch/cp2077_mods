# About this mod

Adds the ability to toggle a infinite ammo functionality to shoot without reloading (except when you toggle on the mod without any ammo in the magazine) and without worrying about ammunition.

**Warning:** Internally, The mod reloads the weapon after every shot, thus will fill the magazine completely. So weapons that increase in fire rate with every shot do not work as intended.

For a better infinite ammunition mod check out: [Simple Menu - An In-Game UI including Hotkeys](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/818).
