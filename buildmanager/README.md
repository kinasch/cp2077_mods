# Build Manager
## About this mod

With this mod you can save, load and reset your builds (attributes, perks and traits) to play around with various play-styles.
As this type of reset (including the attributes) is not part of the base game, this mod may be considered cheating.

**Please please please back-up your saves and maybe take screenshots of your current build.**

## Install:
1) Install / Update [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107) (at least v1.22.0) and [redscript](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511).
2) Download and extract the mod from here.
3) Drag the bin and r6 folders into your "Cyberpunk 2077" game folder.

## Usage:
Open the Cyber Engine Tweaks Overlay and, in the BuildManager window, create new saves or overwrite old saves, load builds or reset your current build. *For every action, please give the script a few seconds.*  
The little icons next to the saves open windows to show some information and to delete the save respectively.

## Uninstall:
1) Close the game and delete the "BuildManager" folders from:  
1.1)  `"Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods"` and
1.2) `"Cyberpunk 2077\r6\scripts"`

## Notes:
Back-up your saves and maybe take screenshots of your current build.   
This mod actively resets attributes and perk points and may cause you to not be able to use your items and skills if something goes wrong.

The script uses the localized names for perks and traits, but not for attributes. Might be changed in the future ... maybe.
