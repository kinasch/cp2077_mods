## Build Manager

With this mod you can save, load and reset your builds (attributes, perks and skills) to play around with various playstyles.
**Please backup your saves and maybe take screenshots of your current build.**

## Install:
1. Install / Update [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107) and [redscript](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511).
2. Download and extract the mod from here.
3. Drag the bin and r6 folders into your "Cyberpunk 2077" game folder.


## Usage:
Open the Cyber Engine Tweaks Overlay while loaded in a game save and, in the BuildManager window, create new saves or overwrite old saves, load builds or reset your current build.The little icons next to the saves open windows to show some information and to delete the save respectively.

## Uninstall:
1. Close the game and delete the "BuildManager" folders from:
`"Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods"` and
`"Cyberpunk 2077\r6\scripts"`
    
## Notes:

* Backup your saves and maybe take screenshots of your current build. This mod actively resets attributes and perk points and may cause you to not be able to use your items and skills if something goes wrong.
* If you're not seeing the Window in the Overlay, try reloading the save and exiting any menu.
* Saves are only displayed if the level you made the build on is lower or the same as your current level (might cause problems, if you're, let's say, level 45,5 and try to access a 45,8 level save, let me know if it does).

Inventory is updated on loading/resetting, so you might unequip some weapons or cyberware.
Use this mod near a ripper doc (or with the [RipperDeck](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/9302?tab=description) mod by psiberx) or your stash/wardrobe (or mods to access them in on the go).
