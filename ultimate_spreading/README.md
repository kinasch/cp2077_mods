# Ultimate Spreader
## About this mod

Lets you edit every (spreadable) quick hack's spread values, such as count and bonus jumps of spreads (as well as range).
Does make quick hacking even more broken than it already is.

## Install:
1) Install / Update [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107).
2) Download and extract the mod from here.
3) Drag the bin and r6 folder into your "Cyberpunk 2077" game folder.

## Usage:
Open the Cyber Engine Tweaks Console and, in the Ultimate Spreader window, change the values for the specific quick hack (you can resize the window).

## Uninstall:
1) Reset to Default (button at the bottom of the window)
2) Close the game and delete the "UltimateSpreader" folders from:
   1) `"Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods"` and
   2) `"Cyberpunk 2077\r6\scripts"`

## Notes:
1) Tested most quick hacks:
   1) A value of -1 either takes your characters value for the spread values or infinity, probably the former. Still haven't figured this out, even months later.
   2) You will need the Ultimate Hack Spreading Ability from specific cyberdecks to be able to spread quick hacks like System Reset.
2) **The Range modifier may break the specific hack altogether.** Thus it is hidden behind a checkbox.
3) I Made this mod to learn a bit about modding, so expect bugs.
