# CritConversion (Surplus Crit Chance to Crit Damage)

Convert your extra chance to do a critical hit into critical damage.

## Install
1. Install / Update [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107).
2. Download and extract the mod from here.
3. Drag the bin folder into your "Cyberpunk 2077" game folder.

## Usage
Just raise your Critical Hit Chance however way you like (up until 5000, arbitrary value). Once you go beyond 100%, every percent over 100 will also increase your Critical Hit Damage Percentage. Depending on the version, this will not be in a 1:1 ratio, like the 2to1 version will increase the crit damage by 1 every 2 crit chance above 100 (or 0.5 for every 1 percent). **Only choose 1 version.**

## Uninstall
Close the game and delete the "Attributes_Uncapped" folders from:
```
"Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods"
```
    
## Notes
* Tested *very* sparringly, without playing any quests, just roaming in the open world, and using commands to increase Crit Chance.
* The mod might need you to restart the game if not installed before starting the game.
