# Attributes Uncapped / Limit Remover

Double click bait title, the attributes are not capped, neither is the limit removed, the cap / limit is just raised to 10,000 (ten thousand).  
*Also check out [Unlimited Attribute Upgrade](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/12034) by [EricDeng](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/EricDeng5972). Same mod idea, different realisation.*

## Install
1. Install / Update [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107) and [redscript](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511).
2. Download and extract the mod from here.
3. Drag the bin and r6 folders into your "Cyberpunk 2077" game folder.

## Usage
Just level up your attributes as usual.
For raising the cap further, see last picture or change the return value of the "GetAttributesUncappedCap" function in "attributes_uncapped.reds" file.

## Uninstall
Close the game and delete the "Attributes_Uncapped" folders from:
```
"Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods"
and
"Cyberpunk 2077\r6\scripts"
```
    
## Notes
* Tested sparringly, without playing any quests, just roaming in the open world, and without going higher than 9,999.
* The mod might need you to restart the game or reload a save if not installed before starting the game.
